SampleJS
========

This is an example project that illustrates how you can use NME to build a project that uses nothing other than traditional Javascript.

Upcoming versions of NME support PhoneGap to enable simple deployment to multiple mobile platforms. Instead of needing to manage multiple project templates, you write your source content, define a straightforward meta-data file and you're ready to go to iOS, BlackBerry and other platforms.
